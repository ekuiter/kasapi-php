##Manage your All-Inkl account with the KAS API for PHP

All-Inkl.com provides an API for automated access to all your accounts, settings, (sub-)domains, databases, cronjobs, mail accounts, ...
This API is called the *KAS API*. To learn more about it, visit the official [KAS API Documentation](http://kasapi.kasserver.com/dokumentation/phpdoc/).
There are also some [example forms](http://kasapi.kasserver.com/dokumentation/?open=beispiele) to try out.

This is a PHP implementation of the API, which provides simple access to all functions provided by the API.
